Alrighty theen, it's been a while since i wrote this page and i feel alot calmer now so i'll go ahead and clarify some of this.

I wrote this during an episode after the whole situation exploded. Some members of the proship tree did take the right action on removing sal from everywhere but i saw some members (not alot but there were there) who joined in on making fun of Sal
I hate sal now, and i will always hate sal for being a groomer but what i wont support is people using these types of things and using it as a gotcha and make fun of people in it.I was groomed multiple times and personally i'd feel uncomfortable if i saw people making fun of someone else regardless if theyre my groomer or not. I also got told off by someone for not wanting to be a part of this whole thing regardless of sides.
I still stand with the victim, i will always stand with victims in these situations but what i wont tolerate is harrassment of both the abuser and the people witnessing the drama.

I distanced myself from the tree as a whole because i felt uncomfortable due to the whole thing being fresh and cause of the bit of betrayal of discovering my friend was a groomer.

I do plan on going back to the tree. Drama or no drama the tree will always be my home and i sincerely apologize if it made it seem like i hated every single one of you. I love you guys to bits 🫂/p

I'll leave the original statement below for archive reasons.

some of you in the tree take drama to the extreme and decide to use it to make fun of people instead of addressing it properly with the sensitivity it needs.
Allegations or not you need to grow up and take things like this seriously or else nobody will take YOU seriously. You lot are the reason the tree gets so much shit.
I'd rather be associated with people who take things like grooming and other allegations of that nature seriously and with the respect it needs.

I am still openly proship but no longer near the tree for obvious reasons.

Respectfully fuck off and never interact with me again.

Edit (16/2/2026): If we were friends before the whole drama thing happened then youre safe to interact. Just know i wont be near the tree anymore.

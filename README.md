## •✦───✧ PONYTOWN ✧───✦•

- I'll mainly be in my soulbond skins in the proship tree. You will **NOT** see this account linked if I'm in the CRK, LMK, LS/MCYT area (I value my sanity soo no death threats from you goofy people soo womp womp 🫵)  
- Don't even bother talking to me about fandom discourse — I have bigger things to worry about than what ppl do in online spaces. I'd rather do that on a diff platform than Ponytown. I quite literally do not care if you are a proshipper or an anti but I will step in if I see some rando harrassing people in a pixel pony game (if you think you're so cool for that then you're not.. you just look stupid and annoying)  
- Interacting, cuddling, hiding is perfectly fine! :3  
- Very awkward — if I suddenly go quiet during a conversation I just don’t know what else to say KSJKAJS — just don’t be rude and we’re good!!  
- If you mention any ships related to Redson, the Beast Cookies, Hajime/Izuru I will block you (for my own sake and comfort)  
- Don’t send friend requests if we didn’t interact much — it floods my list  
- If you recognize me from Tumblr feel free to say hi! :D

## •✦───✧ DNI IF ✧───✦•

**• YOU SHIP ANYTHING RELATED TO REDSON**  
> I am VERY possessive over Redson. I do nooot feel comfortable with any ships with him (that sadly includes other selfships). Do not talk about Redson ships to me — you will be blocked instantly.  
> Y'know what? I’m claiming Redson. He’s mine and y’all can’t do anything about it. We are soulmates in every universe sooo fuck you :D (someone assumed I claimed him before and they got mad sooo I’m gonna make more people mad)  
> We got married last year soo fuck you! I literally have a ring because of it sooo ermm yea you can’t claim him he’s my partner ^^

- Big 3 pro-contact/neutral-contact paraphiles  
- Basic DNI (homophobia, transphobia, racism)  
- Vivziepop apologists  
- People against selfshipping  
- Zionists/Israel supporters  
- Antis (nice/neutral are welcome tho! just be nice and respectful)  
- Radqueers  
- BIGGEST BLOCK IF YOU DEFEND OR SUPPORT TRUMP, ELON MUSK OR ANYBODY RELATED TO THEM

some of you in the tree take drama to the extreme and decide to use it to make fun of people instead of addressing it properly with the sensitivity it needs.
Allegations or not you need to grow up and take things like this seriously or else nobody will take YOU seriously. You lot are the reason the tree gets so much shit.
I'd rather be associated with people who take things like grooming and other allegations of that nature seriously and with the respect it needs.

I am still openly proship but no longer near the tree for obvious reasons.

Respectfully fuck off and never interact with me again.

Edit (16/2/2026): If we were friends before the whole drama thing happened then youre safe to interact. Just know i wont be near the tree anymore.
